      The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from
      Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by
      the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος
      (galaxías kýklos), meaning "milky circle".[26][27] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its
      disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual
      stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all
      the stars in the Universe.[28] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber
      Doust Curtis,[29] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.
      The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400
      ± 3,600 light-years),[10] but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent
      simulations suggest that a dark matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of
      almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc).[30][31] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the
      Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea
      Supercluster
      The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light,
      such as light pollution or moonlight. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in
      order for the Milky Way to be visible.[63] It should be visible if the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or
      better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1.[64] This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from brightly lit
      urban or suburban areas, but very prominent when viewed from rural areas when the Moon is below the horizon.[d]
      Maps of artificial night sky brightness show that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky
      Way from their homes due to light pollution.[65]

      As viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that
      includes 30 constellations.[e] The Galactic Center lies in the direction of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is
      brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the galactic anticenter in
      Auriga. The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky, back to Sagittarius, dividing the sky into two
      roughly equal hemispheres.[citation needed]

      The galactic plane is inclined by about 60° to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the
      celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation
      of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to
      the galactic plane. The north galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4° (B1950)
      near β Comae Berenices, and the south galactic pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination,
      depending on the time of night and year, the Milky Way arch may appear relatively low or relatively high in the
      sky. For observers from latitudes approximately 65° north to 65° south, the Milky Way passes directly overhead
      twice a day</p>
