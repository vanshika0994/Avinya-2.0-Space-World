    <p>At 9:32 a.m. EDT on July 16, with the world watching, Apollo 11 took off from Kennedy Space Center with
      astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins (1930-) aboard. Armstrong, a 38-year-old civilian
      research pilot, was the commander of the mission.

      After traveling 240,000 miles in 76 hours, Apollo 11 entered into a lunar orbit on July 19. The next day, at 1:46
      p.m., the lunar module Eagle, manned by Armstrong and Aldrin, separated from the command module, where Collins
      remained. Two hours later, the Eagle began its descent to the lunar surface, and at 4:17 p.m. the craft touched
      down on the southwestern edge of the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong immediately radioed to Mission Control in
      Houston, Texas, a now-famous message: "The Eagle has landed."

      At 10:39 p.m., five hours ahead of the original schedule, Armstrong opened the hatch of the lunar module. As he
      made his way down the module's ladder, a television camera attached to the craft recorded his progress and beamed
      the signal back to Earth, where hundreds of millions watched in great anticipation.
