 <p>Black hole mergers are beautiful — and some of the most violent events in the cosmos. Here's how the process unfolds.

  The story begins with two black holes orbiting far from each other in long, lazy circles. They could have been born as a binary pair of stars, or they may have just randomly encountered each other in the depths of interstellar space. Either way, to merge, they must get close, which means losing a lot of orbital energy.
  
  The first step in stealing energy from the system is through the black holes' interaction with their environment. They are not alone — there are always thin wisps of gas and dust floating around, and sometimes there are even larger objects, like planets or stars. All of these objects interact through gravity with the black hole. Sometimes, they fall in, never to be seen again. Other times, they just barely miss, getting a little boost to their velocities and sapping some of the orbital energy from the black hole.
  
  Once the black holes get close enough, another process takes over. The black holes stir space-time as they orbit each other, and this stirring releases gravitational waves that emanate from the pair like ripples in a pond. The gravitational waves are incredibly weak, however, and they start to seriously sap energy only when the black holes are very, very close together.
  This has led astrophysicists to a conundrum called the "final parsec problem." Simulations have shown that gravitational interactions with the environment can bring black holes to within about a parsec (about 3.26 light-years) of each other in a decent amount of time. But within that distance, there simply isn't enough stuff to keep pulling away energy. On the other hand, at the same distance, the gravitational waves are far too weak and would take many multiples of the age of the universe to get the job done.
