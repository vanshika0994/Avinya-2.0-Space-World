    <p>Earth is constantly getting pummeled by meteorites. We are unaware of most of them, as they burn up in our
      atmosphere before they hit the ground. Every now and again, though, something larger gets drawn into Earth's
      gravitational field — and when this happens, it usually spells bad news for any life living on our planet's
      surface.

      Scientists know that the vast majority of meteorites that come crashing down to Earth originate from the solar
      system's main asteroid belt: a region between Mars and Jupiter where irregularly shaped rocks left over from the
      formation of the solar system crash into and bounce off each other during their journeys around the sun.

      In new research, however, an international team of scientists are claiming to have identified three young,
      distinct asteroid families in the main asteroid belt as the source of 70% of Earth's meteorites. "Asteroid
      families" refer to a population of asteroids, which could be composed of a handful or hundreds of fragments that
      likely originate from a past asteroid collision.
