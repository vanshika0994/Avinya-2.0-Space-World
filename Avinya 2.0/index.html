                stretches across the sky as seen from Earth. Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy,
                astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of its nature as they do of some external star

                futurist."</h2>
              <p>Nikola Tesla was a genius inventor who created some groundbreaking inventions. Tesla also collaborated
                with many big names and companies in history.
                Because some of his ideas were considered far out there at the time, Tesla is often featured in science
                fiction television shows and movies. Here we shine a light on some of his most notable works and explore
                some other commonly asked questions about the man and his life.</p>

              <h2>"Artificial Intelligence Surpasses Human Understanding"</h2>
              <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the
                intelligence of humans or animals. It may also refer to the corresponding field of study, which develops
                and studies intelligent machines, or to the intelligent machines themselves. AI technology is widely
                used throughout industry, government and science.Problem solving, particularly in artificial
                intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order
                to reach some predefined goal or solution. </p>

              <h2>"What happens when two black holes merge?"</h2>
              <p>Black hole mergers are beautiful — and some of the most violent events in the cosmos. Here's how the
                process unfolds.

                The story begins with two black holes orbiting far from each other in long, lazy circles. Either way, to
                merge, they must get close, which means losing a lot of
                orbital energy.</p>

              <h2>"First person to step on moon~Neil Armstrong"</h2>
              <p> On July 20, 1969, American astronauts Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin (1930-)
                became the first humans ever to land on the moon. About six-and-a-half hours later, Armstrong became the
                first person to walk on the moon. As he took his first step, Armstrong famously said, "That's one small
                step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Apollo 17, the final manned moon mission, took place in 1972.
